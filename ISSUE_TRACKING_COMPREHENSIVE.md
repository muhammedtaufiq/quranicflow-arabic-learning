*Total Issues Tracked: 23*
*Resolved: 23 | Pending: 0*

**ISSUE #18 - Phase-Specific Learning Content**
**Problem**: User reported identical content across different phases despite successful phase switching in dashboard
**Root Cause**: `/api/words` endpoint not using phase parameter + current-phase endpoint returning cached Phase 1 data + frontend query cache issues
**Solution**: Fixed phase filtering, current-phase endpoint to use globalSelectedPhase, added cache-busting headers
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Applied aggressive cache busting with timestamp queries and no-cache headers to force real-time phase sync
**Files Modified**: `server/routes.ts` (phase filtering + current-phase fix), `client/src/pages/learn.tsx` (cache busting)
**Final Verification**: Phase 4 correctly returns Character (Al-Akhlaq) vocabulary with focus on virtues, ethics, behavior. Server logs confirm proper phase switching and vocabulary filtering.

**ISSUE #19 - Word Discovery Runtime Error**
**Problem**: "Expected enabled to be a boolean" error crashing Word Discovery page
**Root Cause**: useQuery enabled parameter receiving non-boolean values in conditional expressions
**Solution**: Wrapped all enabled conditions with Boolean() constructor for proper type casting
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All enabled parameters now properly cast to boolean values
**Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/learn.tsx` (Boolean casting for all useQuery enabled parameters)

**ISSUE #20 - Grammar Mode Using Basic Vocabulary**
**Problem**: Sentence Structure mode showing basic "Allah" vocabulary instead of phase-specific content
**Root Cause**: Grammar mode not implemented in server-side filtering + missing grammar data handling in frontend
**Solution**: Added grammar mode to server filtering logic + implemented phase-specific grammar vocabulary + fixed frontend data handling
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Enhanced grammar mode with structural word prioritization within phase vocabulary
**Files Modified**: `server/routes.ts` (improved grammar filtering), `client/src/pages/learn.tsx` (grammar data handling)
**Final Solution**: Grammar mode now prioritizes structural elements (verbs, particles, definite articles) within selected phase vocabulary

**ISSUE #21 - Excessive Current-Phase API Calls**
**Problem**: Frontend making continuous API calls to `/api/user/1/current-phase` every second causing server spam
**Root Cause**: Aggressive refetchInterval set to 1000ms in learn.tsx causing unnecessary server load
**Solution**: Optimize polling interval and implement smarter cache invalidation
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Reduced API polling from 1 second to 10 seconds with proper cache management
**Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/learn.tsx` (optimized refetch intervals and stale time)

**ISSUE #22 - Missing Phase Indicator in Grammar Mode**
**Problem**: User requested phase indicator for grammar structure mode similar to word discovery
**Root Cause**: Phase indicator only shown for 'words' mode, not for 'grammar' mode
**Solution**: Extended phase indicator display to include grammar mode with purple "Grammar Structure" badge
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Grammar mode now shows phase indicator with specialized grammar badge
**Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/learn.tsx` (extended phase indicator logic)

**ISSUE #23 - Phase Transition Animation Request** 
**Problem**: User requested exciting explosion animation when phases are selected on dashboard
**Root Cause**: Phase selection provided minimal feedback, no celebratory animation
**Solution**: Implemented animated phase unlock celebration that triggers when returning to dashboard after phase progression
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Dashboard detects phase progression and shows 4-second celebration with enhanced explosion effects
**Files Modified**: `client/src/pages/dashboard-redesigned.tsx` (added phase progression detection and dashboard celebration animation)
**Final Implementation**: Animation triggers on dashboard when user progresses to new phase, not during phase selection

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**: Learning content was not using selected phase for vocabulary filtering - fixed by implementing phase-specific content delivery in `/api/words` endpoint with visual phase indicators.

**VERIFICATION COMPLETED**: Phase 6 now serves 425 words from advanced vocabulary (anatomy, colors, etc.) instead of basic foundational words. Phase 5 serves 15 prophetic vocabulary words. Visual indicators added to learning session with teal banner showing active phase.

**TESTING RESULTS**:
- Phase 5: 15 words (prophets category - Isaac, Jacob, Joseph)  
- Phase 6: 425 words (anatomy, colors - heart, hand, face, white)
- Visual indicator implemented with phase name and description
- Server logs confirm proper filtering with sample vocabulary output

**COMPLETION VERIFIED**: All phase switching functionality working correctly, learning content now properly filtered by selected phase, dashboard optimized for mobile-first learning access, and codebase ready for production deployment.

## FINAL STATUS: All Issues Resolved ✅
Phase switching functionality working correctly with proper vocabulary filtering, dashboard optimized, learning content properly differentiated by phase, visual indicators implemented, and application ready for production deployment.
