- `client/src/pages/achievements.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/progress.tsx`
- `client/src/components/phased-learning-dashboard.tsx`

**Root Cause:** Hardcoded user ID references preventing authentication system integration

**Resolution Applied:**
- Replaced all `MOCK_USER_ID` with `user?.id` from `useAuth()` hook
- Added proper query enablement guards (`enabled: !!user?.id`)
- Integrated authentication context throughout application
- Implemented consistent error handling for unauthenticated states

### Issue #2: Session Persistence Problems
**Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** Users getting logged out on page refresh

**Resolution Applied:**
- Enhanced session configuration with proper cookie settings
- Implemented 7-day session expiration
- Added secure session secret configuration
- Configured proper session store for persistence

### Issue #3: User Registration Flow
**Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** New users unable to access application features

**Resolution Applied:**
- Created comprehensive registration endpoint with validation
- Implemented secure password hashing with scrypt
- Added automatic admin assignment for first user
- Integrated registration with existing user management system

### Issue #4: Protected Route Implementation
**Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
**Priority: HIGH**

**Problem:** Unauthenticated users could access protected content

**Resolution Applied:**
- Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component with authentication checks
- Added loading states during authentication verification
- Created automatic redirect to `/auth` for unauthenticated users
- Integrated protection across all major application routes

### Issue #5: Admin User Management
**Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED**
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** No administrative capabilities for user management

**Resolution Applied:**
- Created admin role system with permission checks
- Implemented user management API endpoints
- Added admin UI for user profile management
- Included safety measures preventing admin self-deletion
